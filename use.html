<p><strong>Note: This guide assumes you know how to play Giveaway. If not, click <a href="http://nickthename.github.io/Giveawaybot/howtoplay.html">here</a></strong></p>

<p>Giveawaybot is a bot designed to manage the game Giveaway, by assigning random goals, resolving moves, etc. 
Here are the commands used to interact with Giveawaybot. A "<strong>*</strong>" indicated that the following command should only be sent in a private message to Giveawaybot, not in the game channel. </p>

<p>Most commands should work in private message, however it is polite to use "join" and "leave" in the channel.</p>

<p><em>Note: text surrounded by "[]" indicates fields that should be replaced by user input, not sent literally</em></p>

<h2 id="duringsignups">During Signups</h2>

<p>!join -- Adds the user to the pool of players for the next game.</p>

<p>!leave -- Leaves the player pool.</p>

<p>!players -- Lists the current players</p>

<h2 id="duringanormalmove">During a Normal Move</h2>

<p>!hands -- Tells you the current tokens of all players.</p>

<p><strong>*</strong>!move [first letter of color to give] [name or color of player to give to] -- Sets your move to be "Give [color] to [player]. </p>

<p>For example, "!move g nickthename" would give a green token to the player nickthename. If nickthename started with red, this command could also be written "!move g r"</p>

<p><strong>*</strong>!mymove -- Tells you your current move.</p>

<h2 id="duringrebalance">During Rebalance </h2>

<p>!hands -- Same as above</p>

<p><strong>*</strong>!move -- Same as above, but note some players will not be making moves, and some will make multiple, in which case they should issue the command multiple times.</p>

<p><strong>*</strong>!mymove -- Same as above</p>

<p>!ready -- During rebalance, all moving players must issue this command before the game proceeds, to ensure no accidental moves. (recommended in private message)</p>
