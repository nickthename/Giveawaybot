<p><em>*Note: This game is very much in alpha. Expect problems and/or future changes. *</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Players: 6</li>
<li>Objective: Obtain all tokens specified in your goal</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>All players are given 6 tokens of a different color. Standard colors colors are:</p>

<p>Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet
(roygbv, or simple rainbow colors)</p>

<p>These tokens are public, and must be visable at all times.</p>

<p>Players are also given a goal set of 3 colors to obtain. These colors will all be different, and will not include
the player's starting color.</p>

<h3 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h3>

<p>Steps in a turn:</p>

<ol>
<li>Players discuss, privately or publically.</li>
<li>Players write down (or, if digitally, tell the bot) their move. A move consists of giving one token to one other player.
Written moves can be changed, up until all players have written moves, or a predetermined time limit is reached.</li>
<li>All moves are opened and resolved. </li>
<li>If one or more players has more than 6 tokens, play goes into rebalencing.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="rebalencing">Rebalencing</h5>

<p>During rebalencing, players discuss as normal. However, only players who have more than 6 tokens write down moves. </p>

<p>In addition, these players must write down a number of moves equal to the number of extra tokens they have. For example, a player with 8 tokens would write down 2 moves. These moves must consist of giving to a player with less than 6 tokens, and may not be towards the same player.</p>

<h5 id="winning">Winning</h5>

<p>A player wins at any time where his hand contains the tokens specified in his goal.</p>
