<p><em>*Note: This game is very much in alpha. Expect problems and/or future changes. *</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Players: 6</li>
<li>Objective: Obtain all tokens specified in your goal</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>Each player is given 4 tokens of a single color. The 6 colors are:</p>

<p>Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet
(roygbv, or simple rainbow colors)</p>

<p>What tokens each player has is public information.</p>

<p>Players are also given a secret goal of 3 token colors to obtain. These colors will all be different, and will not include
the player's starting color.</p>

<p>For example, one player is given 4 red tokens at the start of the game. He is secretly assigned the goal of green, orange, violet, which means to win he needs to obtain one token of each of those colors. This goal is kept secret.</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>Steps in a turn:</p>

<ol>
<li>Players discuss, privately or publically.</li>
<li>Players write down (or, if digitally, tell the bot) their move. A move consists of giving one token to one other player.
Written moves can be changed, up until all players have written moves, or a predetermined time limit is reached.</li>
<li>All moves are opened and resolved. </li>
<li>If one or more players has more than 6 tokens, play goes into rebalencing.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note</em>: A player can't give a token to another player that currently has a token of that color.</p>

<h5>Rebalencing</h5>

<p>During rebalencing, players discuss as normal. However, only players who have more than 4 tokens write down moves. </p>

<p>In addition, these players must write down a number of moves equal to the number of extra tokens they have. For example, a player with 6 tokens would write down 2 moves. These moves must consist of giving to a player with less than 4 tokens, and may not be towards the same player.</p>

<h5>Winning</h5>

<p>A player wins at any time where his hand contains the tokens specified in his goal.</p>
