**Note: This game is very much in alpha. Expect problems and/or future changes. **

* Players: 6
* Objective: Obtain all tokens specified in your goal

###Setup
All players are given 6 tokens of a different color. Standard colors colors are:

Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet
(roygbv, or simple rainbow colors)

These tokens are public, and must be visable at all times.

Players are also given a goal set of 3 colors to obtain. These colors will all be different, and will not include
the player's starting color.

###Gameplay
Steps in a turn:

1. Players discuss, privately or publically.
2. Players write down (or, if digitally, tell the bot) their move. A move consists of giving one token to one other player.
Written moves can be changed, up until all players have written moves, or a predetermined time limit is reached.
3. All moves are opened and resolved. 
4. If one or more players has more than 6 tokens, play goes into rebalencing.

#####Rebalencing

During rebalencing, players discuss as normal. However, only players who have more than 6 tokens write down moves. 

In addition, these players must write down a number of moves equal to the number of extra tokens they have. For example, a player with 8 tokens would write down 2 moves. These moves must consist of giving to a player with less than 6 tokens, and may not be towards the same player.

#####Winning
A player wins at any time where his hand contains the tokens specified in his goal.
